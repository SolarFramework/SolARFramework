**SolARFramework** is an open-source framework under [Apache v2 licence](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) making possible to easily create your own camera pose estimation solution to develop Augmented Reality applications. SolAR is dedicated to Augmented Reality (AR).

SolAR is modular and evolutive. It allows, in various contexts of use, the construction of customized computer vision pipelines targeting Augmented Reality applications.

This framework offers a *C++ SDK* to easily and quickly develop and use custom solutions for camera pose estimation or 3D mapping. It provides developers with a full chain from low-level vision components development to camera pose estimation pipelines and AR service development. The SolAR Framework addresses the full chain of AR applications development related to computer vision.

SolAR contains:

- interfaces promoting interoperability
- computer vision components constructed from third-party bricks
- plugins for third-party applications
